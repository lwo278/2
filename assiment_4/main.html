        <h2>History of Pets</h2>       
<p>Pets have been harnessed to humans for possibly tens of thousands of years.  
  
           Regardless of when pet ownership got started, our long attachment to these animals is still going strong.  
Americans own some 78 million dogs, 85 million cats, 14 million birds, 12 million small mammals and 9 million reptiles, according to pet industry statistics. 
  
           The archaeological and genetic record is being combed and analyzed for evidence of when and how the human-animal bond developed, not just to satisfy a craving for trivia, but because it says a lot about the evolution of human society, says Greger Larson, director of the University of Oxford's palacogenomics and bio-archaeology research etwork, which is leading a major international project to determine the origins of dogs.  
          
        People who have pets have free time and wealth, he says. Pets are animals that are kept for pleasure, and they have been tamed and domesticated. A domestic animal has also been tamed, and is kept by humans as a food source, for work, or only for pleasure. Not all domestic animals are pets, though they can be think of a chicken, pig, or a cow. And not all tame animals are domestic an elephant or a tiger, for instance.  
  
        One thing is certain: *We know that dogs, without a doubt, were the first domestic animal," says Larson, meaning that they were tamed and used for work or their fur or meat. But it's unclear if dogs were the first pets  
-that is, kept solely for their companionship he says. So which animals were the first pet? "The answer to that  
Â¿luestion is, nobody really knows," says Larson.

        <h2>How to choose a pet for yourself?</h2>  
        <p class="box"> Whether you live by yourself and desire a companion or you want to make your family complete, the decision to own a pet should not be taken lightly as it comes with a great deal of responsibility - physically, emotionally. and financially.  
  
            There are several factors to consider before zeroing in on the first furry face that captures your alertion as making an impulse decision wthe worst thing you can do. For example, consider what your lifestyle is like (Always traveling? Night ow12), whether or not you have the financial means to care dor a pet for the long-term. the type of environment you live in, whether or not you're able to meet the animal's needs, and whether or not it's the right time in your life to become a pet parent  
Some common choices of companions are dogs, cats and fish.</p>
